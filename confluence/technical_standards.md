Based on NASA's coding rules document and our current Justice Quest implementation, I'll create a specialized rules document that aligns with our legal tech focus and AI integration needs.

# Justice Quest Development Rules

## Core Development Principles

These rules are designed to ensure the reliability, security, and maintainability of Justice Quest, where user privacy and legal document integrity are paramount.

### 1. AI Integration Safety
**Rule**: All AI interactions must be strictly controlled and monitored. No direct, unvalidated AI output should be presented to users without proper sanitization and validation.

**Rationale**: Given our use of AI for legal document processing, we must ensure that AI outputs are reliable and cannot compromise system integrity or provide misleading legal information.

### 2. Document Processing Pipeline
**Rule**: Document processing must follow a strict, auditable pipeline with clearly defined stages. Each stage must have error handling, validation, and rollback capabilities.

**Rationale**: Legal documents require careful handling and tracking. A clear pipeline ensures document integrity and provides audit trails for all modifications.

### 3. State Management
**Rule**: All application state changes must be atomic and traceable. Use database transactions for related operations and maintain comprehensive audit logs.

**Rationale**: In legal applications, data consistency and audit capabilities are crucial. This helps maintain document integrity and provides accountability.

### 4. API Key Security
**Rule**: API keys and credentials must never be stored in plain text. All external service credentials must use the project's key management system with proper encryption and rotation policies.

**Rationale**: Our OpenAI project management system demonstrates the importance of secure credential handling, especially with multiple API keys and projects.

### 5. Error Handling
**Rule**: All errors must be:
- Logged with appropriate context
- Handled gracefully without exposing system details
- Reported through proper channels
- Include recovery mechanisms where possible

**Rationale**: System stability and user trust are essential for a legal platform. Proper error handling ensures reliability and maintainability.

### 6. Code Organization
**Rule**: Follow strict service-based architecture:
- Services should have single responsibilities
- Dependencies must be explicitly declared
- No direct database queries in controllers
- Business logic must reside in dedicated services

**Rationale**: Clear code organization enables better maintenance, testing, and security auditing.

### 7. Testing Requirements
**Rule**: All code must include:
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for AI interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Security tests for document access controls

**Rationale**: Given the critical nature of legal documents and AI processing, comprehensive testing is essential.

### 8. Performance Monitoring
**Rule**: All AI operations and document processing must include:
- Execution time tracking
- Resource usage monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- Usage patterns analysis

**Rationale**: Performance monitoring helps maintain system reliability and identify potential issues before they impact users.

### 9. Documentation
**Rule**: All code must be documented with:
- Clear function/method descriptions
- Parameter and return value documentation
- Example usage where appropriate
- Architecture decisions and rationales

**Rationale**: Clear documentation ensures maintainability and helps new developers understand system design decisions.

### 10. Security First
**Rule**: All development must follow security-first principles:
- Input validation at all entry points
- Output sanitization for all user-facing data
- Regular security audits
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular dependency updates

**Rationale**: As a legal platform handling sensitive documents, security must be a primary concern at all stages.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Daily Practices
1. All code must pass automated tests before deployment
2. Static analysis tools must report zero warnings
3. Security scans must be clean
4. Documentation must be updated with code changes

### Code Review Requirements
1. Security implications must be explicitly considered
2. AI interaction patterns must be reviewed for safety
3. Error handling must be verified
4. Performance impact must be evaluated

### Monitoring Requirements
1. AI operation metrics
2. Document processing success rates
3. System performance metrics
4. Security-related events

## Enforcement

These rules should be enforced through:
1. Automated CI/CD pipelines
2. Code review checklists
3. Regular security audits
4. Automated testing
5. Static analysis tools

## Exception Process

Any exception to these rules must be:
1. Documented with clear rationale
2. Approved by technical leadership
3. Accompanied by compensating controls
4. Regularly reviewed for continued necessity

This rules document adapts NASA's rigorous approach to our specific context, focusing on:
1. AI safety and reliability
2. Document processing integrity
3. Security and privacy
4. Performance and monitoring
5. Code quality and maintainability

The rules are designed to ensure Justice Quest maintains high standards while dealing with sensitive legal documents and AI processing. Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect?

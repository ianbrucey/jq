I'll help you create a technical audit document that we can use to evaluate our current implementation against these rules. Let's structure it as a compliance assessment with actionable items.

✅ Multi-stage processing pipeline
✅ Status tracking system

**Needs Improvement**:
- [ ] Implement rollback mechanisms for failed processing
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error recovery
- [ ] Enhance audit logging for document modifications

### 3. State Management
**Current Implementation**:
✅ Database schema with proper relations
✅ Basic status tracking

**Needs Improvement**:
- [ ] Implement comprehensive audit logging
- [ ] Add transaction management for multi-step operations
- [ ] Create state change validation middleware

### 4. API Key Security
**Current Implementation**:
✅ Encrypted storage of API keys

This assessment gives us a clear picture of:
1. What we've already implemented correctly
2. What needs immediate attention
3. How we can systematically improve our system
4. Concrete next steps and timelines

Would you like to focus on any particular area or discuss specific implementation details for any of the improvement items?

### Project Plan: Address Book Feature for Legal Application
### _(note*** this is a guide. It is not law and is subject to change)_ 

**Project Overview**  
The Address Book feature aims to provide an efficient, flexible, and user-friendly way to capture and manage contact information for various parties involved in legal cases. Users will be able to input, bulk capture, and extract addresses in different formats, including manual entry, voice input, and document analysis. This feature will be integrated into an existing legal application built with Livewire and will support dynamic address entry with a robust verification and management system.

---

### **Goals & Objectives**
1. **Enable Efficient Address Management**:  
   Provide multiple ways to input and manage addresses with ease and minimal user effort.

2. **Flexible Address Input Methods**:  
   Allow users to input addresses manually, through bulk voice input, or by uploading and analyzing documents.

3. **Seamless User Experience**:  
   Ensure the feature is easy to use, and the user feels confident that their data is being captured and stored correctly.

4. **Verification and Validation**:  
   After collecting data through different methods (manual, voice, document), prompt users for verification before saving the information to the system.

5. **Integration with Google Places API**:  
   Use the Google Places API to assist users in manually entering addresses with auto-complete functionality.

6. **Efficient Data Retrieval**:  
   Implement pagination and a robust search feature for the address list, enabling users to easily find and filter entries.

### **Scope**
The Address Book feature will:
- Be a **portable Livewire component** that can be used across the application or as a modal.
- Capture contact information in three ways: manual entry, bulk voice input, and document analysis.
- Integrate **Google Places API** for auto-completion during manual address entry.
- Provide a **pagination and filter system** for managing and retrieving saved addresses.
- Ensure user verification of captured data before final save.

---

### **Deliverables**
1. **Address Input Form**
    - A dynamic expandable form for users to manually input address data.
    - A “Save” button and “Cancel” option.

2. **Bulk Address Capture (Voice Recording)**
    - A voice recorder interface allowing users to dictate names and addresses.
    - AI integration to process the spoken input into structured JSON (party names and addresses).
    - User verification page to confirm the captured data before saving.

3. **Document Upload & Address Analysis**
    - Integration with an OCR service to extract addresses from uploaded documents.
    - AI parsing of document text to identify addresses and parties.
    - User verification page for confirmation before saving extracted addresses.

4. **Google Places API Integration**
    - A field for manual address input, with live auto-complete suggestions powered by Google Places API.

5. **Address List & Management**
    - A list of saved addresses that can be paginated.
    - A search bar with filters to find specific parties or addresses by name or address.
    - Option to edit or delete saved addresses.

6. **Documentation & Testing**
    - Thorough documentation on how to integrate and use the component within other parts of the application.
    - Test cases covering edge scenarios for voice input, document analysis, Google Places integration, and user verification.

### **Resources & Tools**
1. **Technologies**:
    - **Backend**: Laravel, Livewire
    - **AI/Voice Recognition**: Google Speech-to-Text API or similar service
    - **OCR**: Google Vision API or similar service
    - **Address Autocompletion**: Google Places API

2. **Team Members**:
    - **Developer(s)**: Responsible for coding, testing, and integration.
    - **UI/UX Designer**: To create intuitive interfaces for address entry and verification.
    - **QA Specialist**: For testing and bug identification.

---

### **Risks & Mitigation**
1. **Voice Recognition Accuracy**:  
   Voice-to-text conversion may not always capture data accurately.  
   *Mitigation*: Ensure AI models are trained for address patterns and have users review bulk data before saving.

2. **API Limits**:  
   Google Places API and Speech-to-Text services have usage limits.  
   *Mitigation*: Monitor usage and provide fallback options if limits are reached.

3. **Data Validation**:  
   Parsing and structuring addresses from documents or speech may introduce errors.  
   *Mitigation*: Use AI to flag uncertainties and have a manual review step for the user.

4. **User Experience**:  
   If the feature is too complex, users may be hesitant to use it.  
   *Mitigation*: Keep the interface simple and provide clear instructions on each method of address entry.

### **Success Criteria**
- Successful integration of voice recognition, OCR, and Google Places API.
- Seamless user experience in inputting, verifying, and managing addresses.
- High accuracy of data captured from bulk entry and document upload features.
- Positive user feedback on ease of use and efficiency in saving addresses.

### **Conclusion**
This address book feature is designed to be flexible and intuitive, allowing users to input contact information in various ways to streamline their workflow. With built-in AI-powered verification and Google Places integration, the feature will save users time and effort while ensuring the accuracy of the contact information stored.

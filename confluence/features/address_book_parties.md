### Project Plan: Address Book Feature for Legal Application
### _(note*** this is a guide. It is not law and is subject to change)_

**Project Overview**  
The Address Book feature provides an efficient way to capture and manage contact information for various parties involved in legal cases. Users can input addresses manually or have them automatically extracted from uploaded documents using AI analysis. The feature is integrated into the legal application built with Livewire and supports both manual entry and automated document analysis.

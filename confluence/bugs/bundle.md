The main problems I need to fix right now our first the document uploader is no longer showing certain labels like the file name in the preview container after I upload a file. 

The add-communication form is broken in many places. My parties are not showing up in the bottom list after I do the participant search and select a party.
I'm also unable to close the modal by pressing cancel. When I save, the modal does not close. I also cannot see the new communication in the thread view. I don't remember if we do an automatic refresh on the component or we refresh the page altogether but I just know that he no longer works.

I want to take the time and break down each major feature of the application and explain how it works. 
This will help me understand the application better and also help me explain it to others. 
I will start with the most important features and then move on to the less important ones. 
I will also include code snippets and diagrams where necessary to help explain the features better.
This will be living document(s) that I will update as I learn more about the application and its features.
It will, most importantly, help AI understand the application better when implementing new features or fixing bugs.
